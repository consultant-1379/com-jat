<p>
  This option sets the JAT to persist build data in /work/persistedBuildData/ if the plugin fails to dispatch it to the web application.
  The data fetched from the build is stored as *.txt files with random UUID:s as name. Persisted data is dispatched as soon as the post-build action is invoked again.
